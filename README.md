# Music Maker

### Learning Concept: Teaches kids about the basic principles behind music and sound

Goal: Kids can play (or sing) notes into the microphone and the LEDs change color accordingly

This website + an Arduino:
- Takes sound input with a microphone
- Detects the notes that are being played
- Turns the notes into Arduino code
- Causes LEDs to change color based on the note

We referenced code from here to enable pitch detection:
